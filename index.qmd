I am Assistant Professor of Statistics in the Department of Quantitative Methods at Universidad de la República in Montevideo, Uruguay ([UDELAR-IESTA](http://www.iesta.edu.uy)).  I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu) in July 2017, under the supervision of [Di Cook](dicook.github.io/dicook-quarto/) and [Heike Hofmann](http://hofmann.public.iastate.edu/index.html)  with guidance from [Eun-Kyung Lee](https://pure.ewha.ac.kr/en/persons/eun-kyung-lee), who was a visiting professor at Iowa State at that time. My research interests include supervised learning methods, prediction, exploratory data analysis, statistical graphics, reproducible research, and meta-analysis. 
 
I have served as an Associate Editor for Reproducibility at the Journal of the American Statistical Association since 2022 [JASA]([JASA](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=editorialBoard&journalCode=uasa20)). You can check the [JASA Reproducibility Guide](https://jasa-acs.github.io/repro-guide/).

I co-founded the Latinamerican Conference About the Use of R in R&D, [LatinR](https://latin-r.com), in 2018 and have been serving as co-chair of the event since then. Additionally, I co-founded R-Ladies Montevideo [RLadies_MVD meetup](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/rladies-montevideo/) and The R User Group in Montevideo, known as GURU [GURUG meetup](https://www.meetup.com/GURU-mvd/). Most of the courses I teach involve coding in R at various levels. If you want to know more about the R community across Latin America, check [R Fordwards post](http://forwards.github.io/blog/2018/02/05/r-in-latin-america/).
During my Ph.D. at ISU, I also co-founded  [R-Ladies-Ames](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-Ames/)
